About Dataset

The CyberFedDefender dataset is a simulated dataset designed for developing and testing federated learning-based cyber threat detection models. This dataset is tailored for research and experimentation in distributed anomaly detection and privacy-preserving cybersecurity frameworks. It includes traffic features commonly used in intrusion detection systems (IDS) with a focus on cloud and edge computing environments. Each record represents network traffic metadata, with labeled instances of both normal and malicious activities, making it ideal for machine learning applications in cybersecurity.

Dataset Features

The dataset consists of 1,430 instances, with 23 features including information on packet size, duration, bytes sent/received, flow statistics, and attack labels. It covers common cyberattacks such as DDoS, Brute Force, and Ransomware, along with normal network traffic.
